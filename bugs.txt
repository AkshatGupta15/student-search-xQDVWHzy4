- favicon not showing on GHP - manifest being searched for at domain, not at path - check how to configure this
	* solved because path is now top level (/)

- can access pictures (GenericMale, GenericFemale) unlike original site - possibly unsolvable because no config, need to check ghp docs
	* does this really need to be fixed?

- generic pictures take a moment to load in unlike original site
	* solved
